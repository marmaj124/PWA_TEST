						<p>Figuring out who needs to solve a particular problem or question shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team/project at Zen Water, and the head of that team/project should be the first point of contact. </p> <br>
						<p>At the same time, every single person who is in Zen Water is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you’re probably not the first, so speak up! Just to remind you: be honest and don’t be afraid to ask anything if you are not sure.
						</p> <br>

						<p>
							At the beginning of the company's lifespan, we are going to be working together on projects without having teams in the company as there are 4 people in Zen Water right now (updated to March 2021). At the beginning of each ZenCycle, we decide who is going to work on what projects. Eg. Martin is going to work on the website, advertising and email marketing (with the help of Frederik), Nicolaj on economic growth and B2B communication. So a website, advertisement…. projects are going to be created which are separated from others. In other words, files, dates and tasks connected to the project are separated from other projects. Everything will be described as more in-depth in the video tutorial available at the end of the Book of ZEN.

						</p> <br>


						<p>Of course, we have created a potential team structure list for the future, which might be updated in the future. Below you’ll find a list of the major potential future teams within Zen Water. Each team then can create unlimited projects related to that team and field of work.
						</p><br>

						<p><b>EXEC TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for communicating with potential new company partners. They are also improving the structure of the company, they evaluate/adjust core values and ethics within Zen Water. They coordinate our values, long-term direction, short-term direction (ZenCycles), marketing and communication from the macro-perspective and, in the end, they maintain a consistently visible leadership presence with identifying and addressing potential problems in Zen Water.</p><br>
						<p><b>FINANCE TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for the company’s finances. They are focusing on reducing expenses and increasing income. They are also making sure that money is spent wisely within the company.</p><br>
						<p><b>HAPPY TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for the company’s happiness. They are making sure that everyone within Zen Water is happy and they are always in touch with each of us if any problem occurs (even personal ones). They are like psychologists, gurus and advisors in one person. They also help our company with onboarding new employees, they maintain peace within the teams.
						</p><br>
						<p><b>MARKETING TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for the company’s marketing. Wow, so unexpected :) This team is responsible for every type of communication with external people (customers, partners) via all communication channels - SoMe, Emails, Calls, Ads, Videos, Graphics. They are making sure that everyone knows that we are awesome. 
						</p><br>
						<p><b>PRODUCT TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for improving the actual product line (website, drink, visuals, accessories). They are making sure that our products are getting better and better without sacrificing quality and losing customers.
						</p><br>
						<p><b>DIGITAL TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for software, hardware within the company. If our email marketing software doesn’t work, they need to fix it, in other words, any technical problem should be communicated with them. They are always excited to help and they are making sure that they keep their heads cold so they can prevent any arguments related to bugs and technical problems. If everything works within the company, they should discover the functionalities of our current software that we are using and they should improve the effectiveness while using it. 
						</p><br>
						<p><b>XYZ TEAM</b></p><br>
						<p>The team is responsible for creating and implementing new products, techniques, tools into the company itself. They are experimenting with any idea they have how to improve either internal or external things. They don’t have any boundaries as they need to think crazy and outside-the-box because only crazy people can actually change the world, right?
						</p><br>
						<p><b>ZEN COUNCIL</b></p><br>
						<p>After there are going to be at least two people in each team, we can form the Zen Council. In the council, leaders of each team are going to be present in recurring meetups during which they are going to work on revising the way the company is going further towards the future. They might change the way we are going to work and they are going to think of optimizing, automating every activity in the company.
						</p><br>
						<p>Everyone in Zen Water is equal to others in Zen Water. No one is better than others. All of us are equal, even that someone might have more skills, knowledge or responsibilities. Violating this statement means an instant permanent kick from the company. There is no second chance to get back after it happens. We are very serious about making the working environment at Zen Water a happy journey that everyone wants to take.
