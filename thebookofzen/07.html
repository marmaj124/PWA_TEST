						<p><b>We work in 6-week time phases called ZenCycles. There are typically six phases to one year</b>. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, to keep projects and events from ballooning, and provide regular intervals to decide what we’re working on. </p> <br>
						<p>The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six weeks or can be completed at that time. But rather than that, we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time and that bundle smaller things into realistic amounts of work that can be discussed. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely. </p> <br>
						<p>We think of small goals as 1-weekers and bigger goals as 6-weekers (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep bringing new tasks to that goal. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem/goal and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six weeks. Period.
						</p> <br>
						<p><b>Cooldown</b></p><br>
						<p>In between each ZenCycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with smaller issues or problems that come up. Write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should work on next time. There is an option to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to don’t use this option. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal ZenCycle as “pencils down”.
						</p><br>
						<p><b>Communication</b></p><br>
						<p>It’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means if you just watch the stream of the latest activity scrolling along in Basecamp. (It’s also a waste of time and a source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.
						</p><br>
						<p>Firstly, there’s the <b>daily question</b> of 'What did you work on today?', which gives everyone goal/tasks details and a personal narrative to it as well. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week when you’re not having a holiday.</p><br>
						<p>Secondly, there’s the <b>weekly question</b> of 'What will you be working on this week?', which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone is obliged to answer this question when they’re not on holidays. If you don’t receive any notifications from Basecamp, try to ask others in our Zen Space to fix it. You will get more information about this in the video tutorial, which is available to you right after you read through this.</p><br>
						<p>Thirdly, there are <b>heartbeats</b>. These are the team versions of What did you work on this ZenCycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write this account one week after a ZenCycle has ended.</p><br>
						<p>And finally, there are the <b>kickoffs</b>. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next ZenCycle? This is where the plan for the coming two or three weeks is presented. Every team is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write. This needs to be written until the first day of the next ZenCycle. These mechanisms work together to free everyone in the company to run their days and ZenCycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.</p><br>
						<p>All these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project in Basecamp.
						</p><br>
						<p><b>Pitches</b></p><br>
						<p>Whether you work on discussable goals or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.
						</p><br>
						<p>Write-up your idea about a change to our processes, product or communication improvements you think we should consider as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.
						</p><br>
						<p>If an idea is defined in a few words, nobody knows what it means. “Make a new taste” or “Make better graphics” sound sensible, but what exactly do they mean? Team members don’t have enough information to make trade-offs. They don’t know what to include or leave out. That’s why we should write down things to pitches as specific as possible. Additionally, you can use sketches and illustrations to show what you mean.
						</p><br>
						<p>There’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone in the company will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.
						</p><br>
						<p>While a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next ZenCycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each ZenCycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle.
						</p><br>
						<p><b>There are five ingredients you should include in a pitch of kickoff:
							</b></p><br>
						<ol>
							<li>Problem - Initial idea, use case or something that motivates us
							</li>
							<li>Appetite - How much time we want to spend on solving that problem</li>
							<li> Solution - For solving our problems above in a form that’s easily understandable by anyone
							</li>
							<li>Rabbit Holes - Potential problems that might occur during or after the development of solutions (great for reminding us what problems we might face if something goes wrong)</li>
							<li>No-Gos - Anything specific that should be excluded from the development (eg. changing elements on the website) which might take us a lot of time without giving us a proper value.</li>
						</ol>
